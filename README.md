A variation of Godot 4 Camera3D node with shake animations to imitate filming while in motion.

## Usage

1. Install this addon.
2. Run `example_scene.tscn` to see the example use of the camera.
3. Use `shaky_camera_3d.tscn` the same as you'd use a normal Camera3D node.

## Advantages over similar addons

- **Has an MIT license.** Use this for any type of project. You can do whatever you want with this addon!
- **This node extends Camera3D** instead of having it as a child. This means you don't have to go inside the scene to edit camera's properties.
- **Clean file structure.** Files you don't need to see are hidden in `internal/` folder.
